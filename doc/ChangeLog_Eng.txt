History of changes

ExportToFB2.1 Version 1.0
ExportToFB21 Convertor is remake of ExportToFictionBook (web: http://ifolder.ru/3048108). It is rewritten from scratch and includes additional functions. The author of original ExportToFictionBook is Thunder.

The ExportToFB2.1 is exciting convertor made with great idea in mind. Unfortunately that convertor supported only 2 levels of nested headers. By this reasons  I have decided to made it suite my needs. I have fully changed parsing of headers introducing ability to use endless nested headers levels in theory. Also I wished to made this confeverter conforming fb2.1 format as closer as it possible. In this version many things fully rewritten and existing was extended. Paragraph and footnote parsing was modernized. Introduced new algorithms,  while some procedures used from old source-code.
The main idea of this converter belongs to Thunder, and I want to say thank you to him for his work. I have contacted with the author of original converter and he granted me permission to use source-code of his converter in producing other software products.

ExportToFB2.1 Version 1.1
1. Additions: In documents that don't have single level (Header) with epigraph in beginnig of it such epigraph will not be included in <section> element. (In previous version it included. Inspite of this final document was still valid).

2. Corrections: In some documents with complicated structures on related levels there was no </section> element closure in final document. In result of it fb2 document was not valid. Now it is fixed.

ExportToFB2.1 Version 2.0

Document parser is fully rewritten from scratch, so now it has new features.


1. Export of tables with headers. Due to differences in fuctionality of OOo Writer 2.3 and versions below tables export have different results.

Converter have OOo Writer version detection feature and converts table depending on OOo version. For additional information on work with tables in document see p. 4.1.
